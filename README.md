# Bootstrap-Assignment
This assignment involved recreating the portfolio site I made utilizing HTML and CSS previously, and now implementing bootstrap into the site's code.

I created a responsive layout using the .container, .row, and .col attributes, applied the .img-fluid attribute to all images on the main and portfolio pages to make them responsive, and provided a navbar for site navigation.

Most of the formatting was done with bootstrap, but for the decoration, I utilized <style> tags in the html for specific changes. (Such as my portrait on the About Me page that renders horizontally unless I tell CSS to rotate it for some reason.)

*UPDATE*

After figuring out the hierarchy of link tags in the HTML head, I've moved all CSS code for the HTML pages into one consolidated CSS file; making the structure simpler and keeping everything organized into separate, dedicated files.
