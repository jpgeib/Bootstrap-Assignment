# Bootstrap-Assignment
This assignment involved recreating the portfolio site I made utilizing HTML and CSS previously, and now implementing bootstrap into the site's code.

I created a responsive layout using the .container, .row, and .col attributes, applied the .img-fluid attribute to all images on the main and portfolio pages to make them responsive, and provided a navbar for site navigation.
